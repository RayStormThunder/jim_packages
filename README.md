# Skyward Sword Randomizer Map and Item Tracker
## made by j_im
An EmoTracker tracker package for [Skyward Sword Randomizer](https://github.com/lepelog/sslib)

Download EmoTracker [here](https://emotracker.net)

Usage: put zip or folder into ../Emotracker/packs

To mark a dungeon as required, you can click on its label to change the color. Note: this is *strongly suggested* as it controls logic for certain flags in the randomizer that are reflected in the tracker logic.

For Open/Closed Thunderhead options, click the gear cog at the top right of the items box.
